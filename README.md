The worst thing about the internet is anyone can make it

This plugin allows the usage of the dollar sign in place of jQuery in Wordpress sites. It's useful if you've been asked to use some third party code built by developers who didn't think it worth accounting for the software that runs ~40-60% of websites (e.g. ResDiary).

Please note: this has the potential to break a great many things; use it at your own risk.
